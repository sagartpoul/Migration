Oracle ALTER TABLE Statement

In Oracle, ALTER TABLE statement specifies how to add, modify, drop or delete columns in a table. It is also used to rename a table.
How to add column in a table

Syntax:

    ALTER TABLE table_name  
      ADD column_name column-definition;   

Example:

Consider that already existing table customers. Now, add a new column customer_age into the table customers.

    ALTER TABLE customers  
      ADD customer_age varchar2(50);  

Now, a new column "customer_age" will be added in customers table.
How to add multiple columns in the existing table

Syntax:

 

    ALTER TABLE table_name  
      ADD (column_1 column-definition,  
           column_2 column-definition,  
           ...  
           column_n column_definition);  

Example

    ALTER TABLE customers  
      ADD (customer_type varchar2(50),  
           customer_address varchar2(50));  

Now, two columns customer_type and customer_address will be added in the table customers.

How to modify column of a table

Syntax:

    ALTER TABLE table_name  
      MODIFY column_name column_type;   

Example:

    ALTER TABLE customers  
      MODIFY customer_name varchar2(100) not null;  

Now the column column_name in the customers table is modified
to varchar2 (100) and forced the column to not allow null values. 

How to modify multiple columns of a table

Syntax:

    ALTER TABLE table_name  
      MODIFY (column_1 column_type,  
              column_2 column_type,  
              ...  
              column_n column_type);  

Example:

    ALTER TABLE customers  
      MODIFY (customer_name varchar2(100) not null,  
              city varchar2(100));  

This will modify both the customer_name and city columns in the table. 

How to drop column of a table

Syntax:

    ALTER TABLE table_name  
      DROP COLUMN column_name;  

Example:

    ALTER TABLE customers  
      DROP COLUMN customer_name;  

This will drop the customer_name column from the table.

How to rename column of a table

Syntax:

    ALTER TABLE table_name  
      RENAME COLUMN old_name to new_name;  

Example:

    ALTER TABLE customers  
     RENAME COLUMN customer_name to cname;  

This will rename the column customer_name into cname.

How to rename table

Syntax:

    ALTER TABLE table_name  
      RENAME TO new_table_name;   

Example:

    ALTER TABLE customers  
    RENAME TO retailers;  

This will rename the customer table into "retailers" table. 

Oracle DROP TABLE Statement

Oracle DROP TABLE statement is used to remove or delete a table from the Oracle database.

Syntax

    DROP [schema_name].TABLE table_name  
    [ CASCADE CONSTRAINTS ]  
    [ PURGE ];   

Parameters

schema_name: It specifies the name of the schema that owns the table.

table_name: It specifies the name of the table which you want to remove from the Oracle database.

CASCADE CONSTRAINTS: It is optional. If specified, it will drop all referential integrity constraints as well.

PURGE: It is also optional. If specified, the table and its dependent objects are placed in the recycle bin and can?t be recovered.
If there are referential integrity constraints on table_name and you do not specify the CASCADE CONSTRAINTS option, the DROP TABLE statement will return an error and Oracle will not drop the table.
DROP TABLE Example

    DROP TABLE customers;  

This will drop the table named customers. 

DROP TABLE Example with PURGE parameter

    DROP TABLE customers PURGE  

This statement will drop the table called customers and issue a PURGE so that the space associated with the customers table is released and the customers table is not placed in recycle bin. So, it is not possible to recover that table if required.
